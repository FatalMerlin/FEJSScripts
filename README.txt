A simple repository to hold JS/TS Scripts shared by the community
Additions should be in the form [groupname]/[jsname].[ts/js]

For ease of use, please include a js version and optionaly a ts version as well.
This is because Forge Essentials requires ts scripts to be transpiled to js before they can be used.
